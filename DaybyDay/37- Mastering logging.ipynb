    "### Understanding Logging Levels\n",
    "Logging levels are fundamental to the logging process, allowing you to categorize the severity of log messages. Python’s built-in logging module defines several standard levels, with the following being the most commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
    "- INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "- WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.\n",
    "- ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
    "- CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you configure logging, you set a level, and only messages with that level or higher will be tracked. This allows you to adjust the verbosity of your logging output depending on your current needs, such as debugging or monitoring production environments."
