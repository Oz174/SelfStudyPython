-- TIPS 

-- 1)
-- By creating an index that matches the ORDER BY clause in your query
-- you give your database a shortcut to finding the right rows quickly, without having to search through every single row.

create index date_index on transactions(TransactionDate); 
-- query time decreased from 0.015 seconds to 0.000 seconds

-- 2) Partitioning: Organize Your Data Like a Pro â€” Sometimes, your data is like a giant pizza. If you try to eat the whole thing at once, it's overwhelming (and slow!).
--  But if you slice it into smaller pieces, it's much easier to handle
