    "- ## What's a thread and a process?\n",
    "A thread is the basic unit of execution within a process. It is an independent flow of execution that shares the same address space as other independent flows of execution within the same process. A process can have one or more threads, one of them is the main thread, which is the default thread of a Python process\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## What's the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "- **Multithreading** : Many Threads , One CPU core , Shared memory space\n",
    "- **Multiprocessing** : Many Processes , Many CPU cores , Each process has its own memory space\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## When to use multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "- **Multithreading** : Use when you have I/O bound tasks\n",
    "- **Multiprocessing** : Use when you have CPU bound tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## What's the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?\n",
    "The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. It prevents threads from using multiple CPU cores. It is necessary because CPython is not thread-safe.\n",
