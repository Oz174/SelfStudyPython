    "Understanding ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "Before diving into the differences, let's briefly recap what ThreadPoolExecutor does. It's a Python tool that allows you to execute tasks concurrently using a pool of threads. This can significantly speed up tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping (map())\n",
    "Purpose: Applies a function to each item in an iterable and executes these tasks concurrently.\n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "Takes an iterable (like a list) and a function.\n",
    "Submits each element of the iterable to the executor with the provided function.\n",
    "Returns an iterator that yields the results of each task in the same order as the input iterable.\n",
    "Use Case: When you have a simple task to apply to multiple inputs and the order of results is important.\n",
    "Submitting (submit())\n",
    "Purpose: Submits a callable (function) and its arguments to the executor.\n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "Returns a Future object immediately.\n",
    "This Future object represents the pending result of the task.\n",
    "You can check the status of the task, retrieve the result when it's ready, or cancel the task.\n",
    "Use Case: When you need more control over tasks, want to handle exceptions individually, or require asynchronous operations."
